# Django-newspaper-app

I made this app to learn the fundamentals of Django. 
Used the book [**Django for Beginners**](http://leanpub.com/djangoforbeginners) by _William S Vincent_

This is the final Project that was demonstrated in the book which is a newspaper application with **sign in**, **sign up**, **user authentication**, **CRUD operations** and many more

To use the project use the virtualenv 
```venv\Scripts\activate```

Install the packages requried for this project 
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
